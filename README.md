This is the source code for a game called "Apartment 3A" - a short narrative exploration game in the style of old-school survival horror games like Resident Evil. It was made for a class called Level Design & Game Architecture over the course of four weeks, with two of those weeks being used exclusively for design. The game can be played at https://fkawill.itch.io/apartment-3a.

The game was made in the Unity Engine, and features tank-style movement controls, a fixed-camera system, and some visual effects systems for certain areas. An interaction system for certain objects in the environment was planned, but not executed within the 4-week deadline. We may come back to it at some point.

Made by Will Kibel, Tree Diep, Jonathan Doliver, and Eric Sun.
